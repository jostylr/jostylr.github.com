        This is a simple page to point out some of the other projects I am
        working on and a bit of my background. To send me an email, note that
        I use gmail with a user name of jostylr, of course. My real name is
        James Taylor.

          <p>
      A brief pertinent background is that I obtained a PhD from <a
          href="http://www.math.rutgers.edu"> Rutgers
          University</a> in mathematics
      on the topic of <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/">
          Bohmian mechanics</a>, a theory of quantum mechanics.   I also dabble in differential geometry. On
      pleasant occasions, I get to dabble in both simultaneously. This is <a
          href="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~oldstein">my advisor's page</a>.
      As for my professional work, the list below contains my papers.

      <p>
      After a couple of
      years in academia (<a href="http://www.math.iastate.edu/">Iowa State
          University</a>, <a href="http://www.marymount.edu/academic/artandsci/math/">Marymount
          University</a>), I ended
      up in a distance education program (<a href="http://www.cty.jhu.edu">Center for Talented Youth, Johns
          Hopkins University</a>) teaching
      very bright and gifted K-12 students who are eager to learn mathematics. And after a few years of that, I helped manage that program. 
      It was very enjoyable and educational. But all good things come to an end. On August 14, 2009, four years to the business day from when I started 
      and it being Bugbear Day, I left CTY. Sadly, the first Monday afterwards, I was offered a part-time teaching job. I am not very good at being unemployed!
      But I am now primarily a freelance programmer plus other interests. 
      </p><p>
      As for computers, when I was young I had extensive interactions with
      them and was a natural programmer. But during my college and graduate
      years, I lacked a computer (portable computers were not too good in those
      days and I hate clunky desk ones). But once I obtained one again, I
      learned Perl followed by Javascript and PHP and then Python and now Objective-C for iPhone development. Programming is exciting!

<h2> Projects </h2>
<p class="hide"> A variety of projects I am pursuing. </p>
  <div id="projects"> 
   
      <p> My current projects (Release dates): </p>
      <ol>
          <li><a href="http://www.bugbearday.org">Bugbear Day</a>. (Initial: June 14,
          2007). <p> This
          national holiday, every August 14, is the opposite of Valentine's Day. Instead of
          celebrating your loved ones, we celebrate our enemies, our bugbears
          if you will. To do so, give them a lovely gift that is inappropriate
          in some way. This originated with 
          <a href="http://bugbearday.org/history.html">Ralph Waldo
              Emerson</a>. </p>
          </li>

          <li><a href="http://www.goodloepoker.com">Goodloe Solitaire</a>.
          (Initial: November 25, 2007) <p>Goodloe Poker is a poker variant that involves no betting, but a lot of lying.
          Essentially, one person gets a hand. They make a call, pass the hand
          along. If accepted, the next person must call something higher and
          the cycle repeats. If not accepted, then the hand is revealed. If it is lower than the called
          value, the player passing loses. Otherwise, the other player loses.
          After three losses, a player is out. Twos are wild.</p>
          <p> To play this game well, you need to know the poker hands, their
          ordering, and get a feeling for what is easy to improve and what is
          not. To train people to the necessary level, I created Goodloe
          Solitaire. This is a game whose sole purpose is to maximize one's
          score by improving the hand. The end of the game is when you decide
          to end it or one runs out of cards. It is simple, fast, and
          effective. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://jostylr.com/twasciimathwiki.html">Ascii Math and Tiddly Wiki</a>
            
            I modified Peter Jipsen's code for ASciencePad using his <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html"> ASCIIMathML</a>. I found the code and put it in the very much revised version of <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com"> TiddlyWiki </a>
            
            Still seems to work! (May 12, 2010)
            
            Feel free to use this code anyway you see fit and in line with Peter Jipsen's license. 
            
            Import the tiddler ascii to get the functionality; then reboot the wiki. 
            
            The SVG drawing seems broken so ignore the interactive gallery. But the math part seems fine.
